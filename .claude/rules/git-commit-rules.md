# Git Commit Rules

## No AI Attribution in Commits

**NEVER include any of the following in commit messages or code comments:**

- "Generated by Claude Code"
- "Created by Claude"
- "AI-generated"
- "Assisted by AI"
- Any reference to Claude, Anthropic, or AI tools
- Co-authored-by tags for Claude

## Commit Message Format

Write clear, conventional commit messages:

```
type(scope): brief description

- Detail about what changed
- Why the change was made
- Any breaking changes
```

**Types:** feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore

**Examples:**

```
feat(auth): add Firebase session validation

- Implement token expiration checks
- Add refresh token logic
- Handle network failures gracefully
```

```
test(payments): add Stripe error handling unit tests

- Mock Stripe SDK responses
- Cover card_declined, insufficient_funds scenarios
- Verify proper error propagation
```

## Code Comments

Write comments that explain **why**, not **what**:

- ✅ `// Retry payment webhook delivery due to Stripe's eventual consistency model`
- ❌ `// This function handles payment webhooks`
- ❌ `// Generated by Claude Code`

**All commits and code should appear as if written by a human developer on the team.**
